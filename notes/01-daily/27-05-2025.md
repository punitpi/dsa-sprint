# Day 147 – 2025-05-27

## Key Ideas
### #1 - Two-Sum
- Started with Linear approach with two loop that would become O(n^2)
- Used HashMao by creating a variable new Map()
- Added (Value, index) to map after checking if (target - value) is not present in the Map if yes i would return (index, map(target-item))
### #560 - Subarray = K 
- Looked at the linear approach with two loop but did not take it as i knew it was efficient and would take O(n^2)
- Used HashMao by creating a variable new Map()
- Had to map the (currentCount, frequency of the current count) as key value pair
- if the currentCount-k vas present in map then increment the count by map value of currentCount-k
- else set the map(currentCount, (map.get(currentCount) | | 0) + 1)
- return the count in the end
349 Intersection
### #349 - Intersection 
- Could do a linear approach to parse each item in a array one at a time and find the unique common items
- Converted the array into set by new Set(array)
- Then looped one set to do a set.has to find the common intersection items and add them to a result array

## Edge Cases
### #1 - Two-Sum
- Had to check ```n <= 2 && nums[0] + nums[1] === target``` in the beginning to rule out scenario where the array had 2 item and they added up to target
### #560 - Subarray = K 
- Have to init the map with (0, 1) 
### #349 - Intersection 
- None
## Complexity
| Problem             | Time | Space |
| ------------------- | ---- | ----- |
| #1 - Two-Sum        | O(n) | O(n)  |
| #560 - Subarray = K | O(n) | O(n)  |
| #349 - Intersection | O(N) | O(n)  |

### Mini-Summary
| Problem             | Pattern        | Time / Space | Edge-case                        | Mistake                                                                                                                           | Re Solve |
| ------------------- | -------------- | ------------ | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| #1 - Two-Sum        | HashMap lookup | O(n)         | [1,1]; target = 2                | was returning  [map.get(item), map.get(target - item)] <br>instead of [ii, map.get(target - item)]                                | ✅        |
| #560 - Subarray = K | HashMap lookup | O(n)         | Have to init the map with (0, 1) | Could not understand how to solve it had to read the explanation on how to use HashMap and then solve it twice                    | ✅        |
| #349 - Intersection | HashSet lookup | O(n)         | none                             | Did not know what Set was and Hashtable was.<br>looked at the solution to see how the Set is used and was easily able to solve it |          |
