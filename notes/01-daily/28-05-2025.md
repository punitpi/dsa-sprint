# Day 148 â€“ 2025-05-28

## Key Ideas
 ### #217 - Contains Duplicate
- Started with Linear approach with a single loop 
- solved it
- switched to creating a set and then checking the length of set and the array after looking at solution 
### #242 Valid Anagram 
- Had two approaches where i could sort it and then compare the char in a single for
- have two loops. one to add the item and the count to the hashmaps and then another to compare the two hashmaps
- choose the latter approach 
## Edge Cases
### #217 - Contains Duplicate
- if i use the array.forEach() make sure to do any operation and not return anything 
  as it just returned undefined no matter what.
- use normal for loop
### #242 Valid Anagram 
- if i use the array.forEach() make sure to do any operation and not return anything 
  as it just returned undefined no matter what.
- use normal for loop
- could not handle the followup question of handling the unicode char have to do the below to handle it
 ```
  // 1. Canonical Unicode normalization (you can choose 'NFC' or 'NFD')
  const sNorm = s.normalize('NFC');
```
## Complexity
| Problem | Time | Space |
| ------- | ---- | ----- |
| #217    | O(1) | O(1)  |
| #242    | O(n) | O(n)  |

### Mini-Summary
| Problem | Pattern                  | Time / Space | Edge-case                    | Mistake                                                                   | Time Taken |
| ------- | ------------------------ | ------------ | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| #217    | HashMap<br>Length lookup | O(1)         |                              | return inside array.forEach() just returns the forEach and not the method | 20M        |
| #242    | HashMap lookup           | O(N)         | could not handle the unicode | Could not handle the unicode and had to change the forloop                | 30M        |
